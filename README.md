# Installing
Clone this repo, go to Alfred's preferences (Advanced)  
and choose Reveal in Finder.  
Right click to show Package Contents on Alfred.preferences  
navigate to workflows and drop all the content from the repo in place.  

Git pull for future updates

# Deleting
I included all the Dropbox Workflows so the naming is a bit weird.
If you want to delete some workflows you don't need, just install them all,
and delete those from Alfred Preferences.

# Workflows
* Dash Search
* Encode & Decode Hashes
* Alfred Gist
* Github Search
* Golden Ratio Calculator
* MD5 String Hash
* Open Dropbox Folder & iCloud Drive folder
* Search Scenetime, Comixology, Discgos, Fileinfo, KAT, MRTZC, Steam and The Music Fire
* Upload to Imgur
* Package Manager Search
